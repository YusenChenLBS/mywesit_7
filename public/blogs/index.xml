      <description>Since bike sharing comes to popular, it has become a reflection of people’s activities and can show the impact of those great event like covid-19 this year.
In this analysis, we will download bike sharing data from UK gov, and observe the different patterns of monthly bike-hire number between 2014-2016. We use the average number of each month as the expected rental number, and calculate the difference from expected rental number and read rental number.</description>

      <description>Global warming has become the most important social, environment and political topic in the last decades of years.
Considering the massive controversy surrounding global warming, we want to answer the following questions by data that if there is really global warming, and how serious the global warming is. We would download data from NASA, which includes monthly temperature since 1880s. We will use ggplot to visually show the facts of global warming.</description>

      <description>The reversion of US Treasury yield (2Y-10Y, 3M-10Y) has long been seen as an indicator of recession in the next few years.
In this analysis, we would download data from Fed, and compare the time with US yield reversion and the time of recession. We would see if the indicator really works and if it works, how early will this indicator appear before the recession.
First, we will use the tidyquant package to download monthly rates for different durations.</description>
